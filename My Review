Vasyl Ilnytskyy's Code Review

The code overall is well written with clean stylization and good use of a while loop in Task A, making it much more efficent than that of a for loop. While comments would be nice throughout the 
code, the structure of it is written in a manner that makes it easy to understand.

There are potential more methods of testing to see if the code is working in all cases, but the provided example is more than enough to see that it's fully working. There could be more use of the test file but that seems unnecessary due to the nature of the lab.

There is not much to say as the code works well and it's done in an efficent matter, I would grade it at a 10/10 in terms of grading and will be referring to this in the future for anything relating to reformating a text file as they have done it in a very clear matter for me to refer to as a good basis.
