Vasyl Ilnytskyy's Code Review

The code overall is well written with clean stylization and good use of a while loop in Task A, making it much more efficent than that of a for loop. While comments would be nice throughout the 
code, the structure of it is written in a manner that makes it easy to understand.

There is not much to say as the code works well and it's done in an efficent matter, I would grade it at a 10/10 in terms of grading.
