David Cai Code Review by Vasyl Ilnytskyy

    David's code lacks formatting making it tough to read and understand.
His code also does not accomplish everything set out in this lab.

    The removeLeadingSpaces function David coded also only partially works
when the input is a string containing a single word as any string with multiple
words only returns the first word.

    I recommend David to find a coding style guide, like the one linked on the
CSCI 135 website, to keep his workspace formatted and easy to assess. Additionally,
I suggest David to create more tests for the functions he creates so he can build
and improve upon them as he works through the lab. Finally, I recommend that if David
finds a fault in his code that he comment it out instead of deleting it (ie indent)
so that he has reference to what he can improve and move on from.
